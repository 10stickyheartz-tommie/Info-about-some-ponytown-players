**this person has.... thick skins** as ive seen. Ts to why they dance? **they listen to music often** **and have their chat disabled most of the time so they dont wanna be disturbed!** What to do if you see this pony? just dont disturb them, you can either watch (not too close) or walk away.

How to recognise them? you'll see them in their most well known skins!
**SKIN COLLECTION.**
